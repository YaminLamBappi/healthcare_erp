            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Importance of ERP in Healthcare</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are crucial in the healthcare sector for
                integrating and managing key business processes in real-time. They provide a unified platform for
                different departments, improving efficiency and accuracy in operations.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">With an ERP system, healthcare organizations can streamline their administrative processes,
                ensure compliance with regulations, and enhance patient care. The ability to have a comprehensive view
                of the organizationâ€™s operations helps in making informed decisions and improving overall performance.
            </p>
            <p>ERP systems in healthcare play a vital role in ensuring that all aspects of a healthcare facility work in
                harmony. By integrating various functions such as patient management, billing, scheduling, and
                inventory, ERPs help in reducing errors and improving service delivery.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Usage of ERP in Healthcare</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">ERP systems in healthcare are used for a variety of functions, including:</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Patient Management</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">ERP systems help in managing patient information efficiently. This includes tracking patient
                history, managing appointments, and storing medical records. This ensures that patient data is always
                up-to-date and easily accessible to healthcare providers.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Appointment Scheduling</h3>

                managing appointments, reducing wait times, and improving patient satisfaction.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Billing and Invoicing</h3>

                ensuring that billing is accurate and timely, and reducing the administrative burden on staff.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Inventory Management</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Managing medical supplies and inventory is critical. ERP systems help track inventory
                levels, manage orders, and reduce waste by ensuring that supplies are used efficiently.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Human Resources Management</h3>
            <p>ERP systems also manage HR functions such as employee records, payroll, and performance tracking. This
